<h1>Live Studio Terms of Service</h1>

<h2>Introduction and Acceptance of the Terms and Conditions</h2>

<p>The general Terms and Conditions of Sale detailed below govern the contractual relationship between the ‘User’ (hereafter also referred to as ‘You’ or the ‘Customer’) and ‘Live Studio Print’ (hereafter also referred to as ‘We’ or the ‘App’), belonging to Aaron Satterfield doing business as Live Studio. Both parties accept these Conditions unreservedly. These general Conditions of Use are the only conditions that are applicable and replace all other conditions, except in the case of express, written, prior dispensation. We maintain that, by confirming your order or creating an account, you have read and do unreservedly accept our general Conditions of Use. These Terms and Conditions of Use are important to you and Live Studio as they are used to protect your rights as a valued customer and our rights as a business.</p>

<h2>Changes to the Terms of Service and the App</h2>

<p>Live Studio is a work in progress, and as such things may change, be added or be taken away. We reserve the right to update the App and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion and without any notice. It is solely your responsibility to keep up-to-date with the latest Terms and Conditions by checking back regularly. Your continued use of the App following the publishing of updated Terms of Service will be taken to mean that you have read and agree to the changes.</p>

<h2>Access to the App</h2>

<p>We work hard to ensure the App is stable and available, but we can&#39;t guarantee that the App will not have downtime or crash for any reason. We reserve the right to close the App or remove products from sale for short periods of time for regular updating of products and for general maintenance, but will attempt to keep this to a minimum. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website is unavailable at any time, for any length of time.</p>

<p>Parts of the App require you to input a password to access certain features. This is to be able to give you details relevant to your order whilst still keeping them private to you. To do this, as part of our security procedures, we require you to register an account with Live Studio by entering your email and choosing a secure password. We highly recommend that you choose a strong password that is hard for others to guess. There is a password reset procedure in case you forget your password. You must treat your account log-in information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using Live Studio in person. If you think there may have been any breach of security then it is your responsibility to notify us immediately and if log-in is possible, to change your password.</p>

<p>It is a condition of your use of the App that all the information you provide on the Website is correct, current and complete. We reserve the right to disable any user account in our sole discretion, at any time for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms of Service.</p>

<p>SSL encryption is enabled on all requests between the App and it’s backend servers, but while we strive for this, we cannot guarantee that all use will be secure. While we work hard towards this, we also do not guarantee that the App or any content provided on the Website is error free. We manage your personal data according to our Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Product information</h2>

<p>Live Studio takes great care when putting product information, descriptions and images but will not be held responsible for any mistakes or omissions to any information given. You may contact us by email if you need any clarification. </p>

<h3>Prices</h3>

<p>The prices indicated on Live Studio are shown in US Dollar and include all taxes but do not include delivery. The delivery costs or processing fees are clearly shown and invoiced at the end of the order in addition to the price of the products. We reserve the right to modify our prices at any moment but this will be indicated to you on the order at the time the order is placed. If an obviously incorrect price appears on our website and is not corrected on your total at the time of order completion, for whatever reason (human error, technical error etc.), your order will be cancelled and the payment refunded to you, even if it has been initially validated. We reserve the right to cancel and refund any order for any reason.</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>

<p>We will always endeavor to fulfill your order once completed and paid for. If a product should become unavailable after your order has been confirmed and paid for, we will refund the price you paid for the product within 30 days following the date of payment. If your order includes products that are temporarily unavailable, we will wait until we have all products before sending your order. If relevant, we will offer you a replacement for an unavailable product, a product of equal price and quality. If you choose to decline this offer, and the original product is permanently unavailable, we will reimburse the price of the unavailable product.</p>

<h2>Secure payment</h2>

<p>Live Studio currently offers two ways to pay for your order, Apple Pay and Stripe. Both these payment options use advanced SSL encryption to keep your transaction secure and do not cost you anything to use (Live Studio is charged as the seller, you are not charged as the buyer) so you will not pay any extra for your order. You do not need to hold an account with these Merchants to use these methods of payments. Please refer to Apple Pay and Stripe for full terms and conditions of use. The indicated processing fee only accounts for the time to prepare and ship your order, not the transaction fee charge to us by these companies.</p>

<h2>Delivery</h2>

<p>Your order will be delivered to the address you indicated when your order was placed. The products bought on Live Studio will be delivered to one address in the United States. We do not deliver to addresses outside the 50 United States.</p>

<p>Live Studio does everything in its power to respect the delivery times indicated on the website. We cannot, however, be held responsible for the consequences of a late delivery or the loss of a package caused by a third-party contracted to make delivery, or by you, or because of some unforeseen event or an Act of God. In the event where you do not receive your package, an investigation will be conducted with the carrier and may take several days upon receipt of your claim. During this period of investigation, no reimbursement or re-delivery will take place.</p>

<p>If your product is shown to be available on our app when you place your order, delivery schedules are:</p>

<p>Payment validation + order preparation and printing + parcel collection by carrier = 24-72 hours</p>

<p>+</p>

<p>Delivery times of your parcel(s) according to the carrier you have chosen. Carrier delivery times start from the moment you receive an e-mail confirming order dispatch. Dispatch and delivery times are given in working days.</p>

<h2>Refunds and Returns</h2>

<p>Due to the custom nature of printed products, no returns will not be accepted. Unless we determine a mistake was made on our part. If we found that we are at fault for the mistake, we will do our best to recreate your order with corrections and send the corrected product to you at our cost.</p>

<p>Product warranties</p>

<p>All products sold on the App, whether they are new or used, come with a legal guarantee concerning product conformity, as outlined in the following legal clauses. The aforementioned guarantee may be used in conjunction with extended warranties. Pursuant to the legal guarantee concerning product conformity, Live Studio commits to delivering your order in accordance with the provisions of the concluded sales agreement. We will also take responsibility for any latent defects noticed upon delivery.</p>

<p>To comply with the terms of the contract, products must:</p>

<p>1) Match the description given on the website.</p>

<p>2) Be suitable for the purpose usually associated with such a product, or be suitable with any other purpose required by the customer. The customer will have informed Live Studio of the required purpose before placing their order, and Live Studio will have formally confirmed the suitability of the product.</p>

<p>3) Have the features and purpose that customers would expect from such a product, given the product type and description on the website.</p>

<p>In the case of a lack of conformity, you shall be entitled to have the goods brought into conformity free of charge by repair or replacement. The legal guarantee concerning product conformity covers all latent defects discovered within 14 days from the date your product was delivered.</p>

<p>If you notice a problem with your product immediately contact us by email using the contact information on our website or within the App. </p>

<p>The legal guarantee concerning product conformity does not apply in some cases:</p>

<ul>
	<li>when damage is caused by external factors such as shocks, lightning, power surges, rust and sand.</li>
	<li>when damage is caused by the customer’s non-respect of the manufacturer’s instructions regarding the use and installation of the product.</li>
	<li>when damage is caused by the customer’s misuse of the product.</li>
</ul>

<p>Manufacturers’ warranties for defective products: In addition to legal guarantees, some products sold on the website come with a manufacturer’s warranty. Manufacturers’ warranties vary in terms of length and coverage depending on the product and brand.</p>

<p>Manufacturers’ warranties do not cover:</p>

<ul>
	<li>replacement consumables such as batteries, light bulbs, fuses and recording or playback heads,</li>
	<li>improper use of the product, </li>
	<li>damage resulting from repairs performed by non-certified technicians, </li>
	<li>damage caused by external factors such as accidents, internal or external shocks, lightning, power spikes, rust and sand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please read the user manual supplied with your product(s) carefully for the exact terms and conditions of the manufacturer’s warranty. Should the manufacturer not honor the terms of the warranty for any of the aforementioned reasons, Live Studio will not be held responsible.</p>

<p>In cases where the manufacturer’s warranty is not applicable, the manufacturer will provide the customer with an estimate repair fee. If you would like your product(s) to be returned to you by the manufacturer without any repairs being carried out, administration charges may apply. Should you choose to abandon your product altogether, no additional charges will apply.</p>

<p>You have 3 months to accept or reject the quote and pay the amount due. If we do not hear from you within this time, we will assume that you have rejected the quote and abandoned your product. No compensation will be issued.</p>

<p>Our after-sales service will only attempt to send products to customers twice. If we are unable to deliver your parcel on both occasions, (i.e. parcel refused, delivery impossible, etc.) your product will be returned to Live Studio’s logistics centre, where you’ll be able to collect it within 3 months. After this time, we will assume that you have abandoned your product, and Live Studio will reserve the right to destroy your item. No compensation will be issued.</p>

<p>If there is a fault with your product within 12 months of delivery (or other defects with your order), we will normally offer a prompt repair or exchange. You will always have the option of an exchange or refund if the fault occurs within 14 days of delivery. In all cases we reserve the right to inspect the product and verify the fault.</p>

<p>To qualify for a refund or exchange, the product must be in “as new” condition, and complete, with any accessories and free gifts offered with it (and, if possible, the original box and packaging). This warranty does not cover faults caused by accident, neglect, misuse or normal wear and tear. Any refund due to a fault or other defect will include a refund of the applicable delivery charge. We will also pay for our costs of collecting goods for replacement or refund. Replacement goods are sent by standard delivery only.</p>
